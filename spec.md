# Drizzle-like Database Management Studio

## Context
The project is a web-based database management studio similar to Data Studio, providing a modern interface for database operations and management.

## Current Status
### Completed Features
1. Basic project structure and setup
   - Express server with Remix frontend
   - TypeScript configuration
   - WebSocket communication layer
   - Dark mode support

2. UI Components
   - Side navigation with Tables and Query pages
   - Dark/Light theme toggle
   - SQL query editor with formatting
   - Table structure viewer and editor with tab interface

3. Database Operations
   - Basic database connection and pooling
   - Table listing functionality
   - SQL query execution
   - Query results display
   - Table structure viewing and editing
   - Column management (add, remove, modify)
   - Primary key management

### Remaining Work

#### 1. Core Features
- [x] Add table structure viewing and editing
- [ ] Implement data editing capabilities in table view
- [ ] Add support for complex filtering, sorting, and pagination
- [ ] Add support for saved queries
- [ ] Implement query history
- [ ] Add export functionality for query results
- [ ] Create exportable UI that can be implemented in other projects
- [ ] Add support for a query client that can be implemented in other projects similar to the supabase-js client: https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js
- [ ] Create build pipelines for CI/CD in github to deploy the packages to npm.

#### 2. UI Enhancements
- [ ] Add loading states for all operations
- [ ] Improve error handling and error messages

- [ ] Add development tools and utilities
- [ ] Create example projects and use cases

## Next Steps
1. ~~Prioritize table structure viewing and editing~~ (Completed)
2. Implement data editing capabilities
3. Add syntax highlighting and auto-complete for better query writing experience
4. Improve error handling and add proper loading states
5. Begin work on authentication system

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure proper type safety throughout the application
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Keep the UI responsive and user-friendly
- Follow security best practices for database operations
- Maintain backward compatibility for API changes
