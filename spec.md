## Next Steps
1. ~~Add table structure viewing and editing~~ (Completed)
2. ~~Add empty states for all views~~ (Completed)
3. ~~Implement proper theme support~~ (Completed)
4. ~~Implement data editing capabilities~~ (Completed)
5. ~~Add row details viewing with card-based UI~~ (Completed)
6. Add loading states and improve error handling
